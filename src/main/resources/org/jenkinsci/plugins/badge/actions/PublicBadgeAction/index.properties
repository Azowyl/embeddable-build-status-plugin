blurb=Jenkins exposes the current status of your build as an image in a fixed URL. \
      You can put this URL into other sites (such as GitHub README) so that people \
      can see the current state of the build. <br/><br/> \
      <h3>Note</h3> \
      This is the "untethered" version of the badge resolving to <b>no specific build or job</b>.<br/><br/> \
      Supported query parameters are: <tt>style</tt>, <tt>subject</tt>, <tt>status</tt>, <tt>color</tt> and <tt>animatedOverlayColor</tt>. \
      <h2>Configuration</h2> \
      Please read <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/embeddable-build-status-plugin#embeddable-build-status-plugin">here</a> on how to configure and customize your badge.
