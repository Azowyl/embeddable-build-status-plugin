blurb=Jenkins exposes the status of the specific build as an image in a fixed URL. \
      You can put this URL into other sites (such as GitHub README) so that people \
      can see the state of the specific build. <br>There are two variants available for inclusion: <br> \
      <ul>  \
       <li><b>with view</b> includes the current view into the URL.</li> \
       <li><b>without view</b> contains the direct path to the build excluding the current view</li> \
      </ul> \
      <br>For each variant there are two URLs available for inclusion: <br> \
      <ul>  \
       <li><b>protected</b> exposes the badge to users having at least 'Read' permission on the job</li> \
       <li><b>unprotected</b> exposes the badge to users having at least 'ViewStatus' permission on the job</li> \
      </ul> \
      If you want the status icons to be public readable/accessible, just grant the 'ViewStatus' permission globally to 'anonymous'. \
      <h2>Query-Parameters</h2> \
      <h3>style</h3> \
      <br>There are two styles available: \
      <ul> \
        <li><b>flat</b> (default since version 1.7)\
        <li><b>flat-square</b>\
        <li><b>plastic</b> (the one used in version 1.5)\
      </ul> \
      You can choose the one you prefer by appending <tt>?style=plastic</tt> to the URL. \
      <h3>subject</h3> \
      <br>You can change the label of the badge by appening <tt>?subject=Label</tt> to the URL. \
      <h3>status</h3> \
      <br>You can override the status of the badge by appening <tt>?status=Status</tt> to the URL. \
      <h3>color</h3> \
      <br>You can override the color of the badge by appening <tt>?color=Color</tt> to the URL. \
      <br><tt>color</tt> can be: \
      <ul> \
        <li>one of the values: <tt>red</tt>, <tt>brightgreen</tt>, <tt>green</tt>, <tt>yellowgreen</tt>, <tt>yellow</tt>, <tt>orange</tt>, <tt>lightgrey</tt>, <tt>blue</tt></li> \
        <li>a valid hexadecimal HTML color <b>without</b> the hashtag (e.g. FFAABB).</li> \
        <li>any valid <a href="https://www.december.com/html/spec/colorsvg.html">SVG color name</a></li> \
      </ul>
blurb_text=Jenkins also exposes the current status of your build in plain text. \
      You can use this in external scripts for easier interpretation of the current state of the build. \
      Similar to the badge there are both <b>with view</b> and <b>without view</b> for <b>protected</b>, as well as <b>unprotected</b> variants.
